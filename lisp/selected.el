;;; Commentary:

;; When `selected-minor-mode' is active, the keybindings in `selected-keymap'
;; will be enabled when the region is active.  This is useful for commands that
;; operates on the region, which you only want keybound when the region is
;; active.
;;
;; `selected-keymap' has no default bindings.  Bind it yourself:
;; 
;; (define-key selected-keymap (kbd "u") #'upcase-region)
;;
;; You can also bind keys specific to a major mode, by creating a keymap named
;; selected-<major-mode-name>-map:
;; 
;; (setq selected-org-mode-map (make-sparse-keymap))
;; (define-key selected-org-mode-map (kbd "t") #'org-table-convert-region)

;;; Code:
(defvar selected-keymap (make-sparse-keymap)
  "Keymap for `selected-minor-mode'.  Add keys here that should be active when region is active.")

(define-minor-mode selected-region-active-mode
  "Meant to activate when region becomes active.  Not intended for the user.  Use `selected-minor-mode'."
  :keymap selected-keymap
  (when selected-region-active-mode
    (let ((major-selected-map

          (setf (cdr (assoc 'selected-region-active-mode minor-mode-map-alist))

                  (set-keymap-parent map selected-keymap)
                  map))
        (setf (cdr (assoc 'selected-region-active-mode minor-mode-map-alist))
              selected-keymap)))))
